Professional Alignment GPT

Overview

This project defines a structured instruction architecture for a GPT-based assistant designed to evaluate professional alignment.

Rather than generating résumé summaries or persuasive narratives, this system evaluates:
• Operational scope and decision pressure
• Governance clarity and authority boundaries
• Systems maturity and organizational design
• Structural leverage zones
• Long-term execution sustainability

The goal is to translate job descriptions into execution reality and map documented experience to structural fit.

This is not a personality interpreter and not a promotional tool.
It is a systems-level evaluation framework.

Design Principles
This GPT is built around the following constraints:
  • Third-person analytical voice
  • Evidence-based alignment (no invented experience)
  • Structural framing (not personality framing)
  • Governance lens over emotional lens
  • Decision-right clarity
  • Incentive transparency
  • Planning rigor
  • Organizational maturity
  • Output Structure

When provided a job description, the GPT produces analysis in the following order:

• Role Translation:  Converts responsibilities into operational reality.
• Alignment Mapping:  Maps documented strengths and execution history to role requirements.
• Leverage Zones: Identifies where disproportionate impact is likely.
• Structural Considerations:  Identifies environmental conditions influencing long-term effectiveness.
• Clarifying Questions: Surfaces strategic questions regarding ownership, success metrics, and governance boundaries.

Intended Use

This framework is intended for:
• Executive-level role evaluation
• Director / VP-level role calibration
• Structured interview preparation
• Organizational maturity assessment

It is particularly effective in complex, cross-functional, or systems-heavy environments.

Why This Exists

Traditional hiring artifacts (résumés, cover letters) often compress operational nuance.

This framework was designed to:
• Preserve structural thinking
• Surface execution architecture
• Avoid defensive tone drift
• Replace persuasion with governance clarity

It treats role alignment as a systems design problem.

Implementation
