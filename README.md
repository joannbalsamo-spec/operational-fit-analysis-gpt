Professional Alignment/Analysis GPT

Overview

This repository defines a structured instruction architecture for a GPT-based assistant designed to evaluate professional role alignment through a systems and governance lens.

Rather than generating résumé summaries or persuasive narratives, this framework evaluates:
•	Operational scope and decision pressure
•	Governance clarity and authority boundaries
•	Systems maturity and execution architecture
•	Structural leverage zones
•	Long-term sustainability of impact

The goal is to translate job descriptions into execution reality and map documented experience to structural fit.

This is not a personality interpreter and not a promotional tool.  It is a systems-level evaluation framework.

[Note: Access may require a ChatGPT account]

Design Principles
This GPT is built around five constraints:
1.	Third-person analytical voice  
2.	Evidence-based alignment (no invented experience)  
3.	Structural framing (not personality framing)  
4.	Governance lens over emotional interpretation  
5.	Explicit prohibition on combative or defensive narratives  

Descriptions / responses may include information around:
•	Decision-right clarity
•	Incentive transparency
•	Planning rigor
•	Organizational maturity

Output Structure

When provided a job description, the GPT produces analysis in the following order:
1. Role Translation: Converts responsibilities into operational reality.
2. Alignment Mapping: Maps documented strengths and execution history to role requirements.
3. Leverage Zones: Identifies where disproportionate impact is likely.
4. Structural Considerations: Identifies environmental conditions influencing long-term effectiveness.
5. Clarifying Questions: Surfaces strategic questions regarding ownership, success metrics, and governance boundaries.

Intended Use

This framework is intended for:
•	Executive interview preparation
•	Organizational maturity assessment
•	Structured hiring conversations

It is particularly effective in complex, cross-functional, or systems-heavy environments.

Implementation

This repository contains the system instruction set used to configure a Custom GPT inside the ChatGPT platform.

To deploy:
1. Create a new Custom GPT.
2. Paste the instruction set from `system-instructions.md`.
3. Upload supporting documentation (résumé, profile addendum, systems profile).
4. Test against live job descriptions.
